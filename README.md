# Git Essentials Lab

Practice 12 Git topics in a small Java library application, then combine them in a final task. Each exercise starts in its own repository with a prepared history. You can repeat a topic without undoing another exercise.

The application is deliberately small: borrowing limits, loan periods, overdue fees, catalog search, and loan receipts. The learning target is Git. No framework, third-party Java library, or Maven download is required.

## Start here

1. Complete [Setup](docs/SETUP.md) once. You need Git 2.23+, JDK 17+, Python 3.9+, and your own GitHub fork.
2. Keep the clone you set up as your **launcher**. Run `lab.py` from that directory.
3. Open an exercise below and create a separate workspace with `lab.py start`.
4. Work in that workspace, then check it from the launcher. Read [Submission](docs/SUBMISSION.md) before publishing results.

Examples use `python3`. On Windows, use `py -3` if that is how you run Python 3.9 or later.

```text
python3 lab.py doctor
python3 lab.py refs
python3 lab.py start 01
```

`start` prints the new workspace path and a reminder to check that workspace's [Git editor setting](docs/SETUP.md#5-choose-a-git-editor-before-making-commits). Use that path when changing directories or passing `--repo` to a check. It creates a new directory; it does not reset your launcher or an existing workspace.

Read the exercise's situation and success conditions before editing. Each page identifies its starting state, required result, checks, submission, and restart procedure. Exercises 04, 09, 10, and Final also have a variant B for another attempt with changed requirements.

Without `--variant b`, `start` uses the default scenario described first on each page. `check` reads the variant recorded when that workspace was created, so the same check command works for either variant. `python3 lab.py instructions 04` prints the current Exercise 04 page from the launcher; replace `04` with another exercise ID as needed.

Submit only the variant assigned by your instructor; if none is assigned, use the default variant A. Both variants use the same submission branch names. Keep an optional second variant local rather than overwriting the submitted result. See [Choosing an A or B attempt](docs/SUBMISSION.md#choosing-an-a-or-b-attempt).

## The two places you work

| Place | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Launcher: your original clone | Read the current instructions; run `lab.py doctor`, `start`, `check`, and `advance`. |
| Exercise workspace: the directory printed by `start` | Inspect Git history, edit the application, run Git commands, and publish the named result branch. |

The versioned starting tags are fixed snapshots. A workspace may therefore contain an older copy of the documents or tools, including older test-output wording. Always read the current instructions and run `lab.py` from the launcher; do not change the starting tags to update a workspace.

If an old workspace's `lab.py` reports `Cannot read the launcher's exercises/manifest.json`, return to your original launcher and run the check there with `--repo` pointing to the workspace. See [the recovery commands](docs/SETUP.md#cannot-read-the-launchers-exercisesmanifestjson) for a complete example.

For example, after starting Exercise 01, run its check **from the launcher**, replacing the example path with the path printed by `start`:

```text
python3 lab.py check 01 --repo "../git-lab-work/01-YOUR-TIMESTAMP"
```

Checks evaluate the workspace's **current checked-out commit (`HEAD`)** and the local state required by that exercise. Read the evaluated branch and commit in the output: passing on a feature branch does not mean the result branch has been updated. For Exercise 04 and Final, the local check does not verify the GitHub PR's existence or merged state; check before publication, then check the merged target again and confirm the PR on GitHub.

A passing result does not prove that you used a particular command or understood why it worked. Practice the topic deliberately and be ready to explain the resulting history and application behavior. Local-only practice is identified on the relevant pages and is not remotely graded.

## Explore the application

From the launcher, you can inspect the unchanged application before starting:

```text
python3 run.py demo
python3 run.py test
```

The runner compiles the Java code into a temporary directory. **`run.py test` without expectation options tests the original baseline**, including borrowing limits, loan periods, overdue fees, and search behavior. Exercise requirements can intentionally change those rules. A correct exercise solution can therefore fail the baseline test. To evaluate an exercise, return to the launcher and use its `lab.py check ID --repo PATH` command, which selects that exercise and variant's expected behavior.

Useful application files are under `src/library/`; tests are under `tests/library/`. Git exercise starting points are the versioned `lab-v1/...` tags. Keep those tags unchanged so every attempt has the same starting point.

## Help

- [Setup](docs/SETUP.md): tools, fork, all branches and tags, remotes, and Git editor save/exit instructions.
- [Submission](docs/SUBMISSION.md): what to publish and which pull-request repositories to select.
- [Hints](docs/HINTS.md): how to inspect state and recover from an interrupted operation.
- [Starting graphs](docs/GRAPHS.md): the initial histories for 04, 09, 10, and Final, including private setup commits.
- [Sources](SOURCES.md): Git, Pro Git, and GitHub references used to design the exercises.

If you need to begin again, run `start` again from the launcher. Keep the old attempt until you are satisfied with the new one.
